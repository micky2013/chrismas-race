# Christmas Race

This is a simple web-based game where Christmas characters race through obstacles in a snowy environment. The goal is to avoid the obstacles and beat the race!

## How to Run Locally

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to play the game.

## How to Deploy to Netlify

1. Create a GitHub repository for the project.
2. Upload the project files (index.html, style.css, script.js, etc.) to your GitHub repository.
3. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) and click on "Add New Site."
4. Choose "Import from GitHub" and select your repository.
5. Follow the instructions to deploy the site. Netlify will assign a live URL (e.g., `my-christmas-race.netlify.app`).

## Customizing the Game

- You can replace the `assets/santa.png` with your own character images.
- You can adjust the `raceDuration` and `characterSpeed` in the `script.js` file to change the game dynamics.

## Demo Data Mode

If you don't have a custom data file, the app will use built-in demo data to simulate a race. You can always switch to demo mode by modifying `script.js`.
